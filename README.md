A mental health chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to provide 24/7 confidential support, resources, and guidance for individuals seeking help with their mental health. Utilizing natural language processing (NLP), the chatbot engages in empathetic, human-like conversations, offering immediate assistance, coping strategies, and personalized recommendations. It can provide information on mental health topics, track moods, and journal entries, and direct users to helpful resources, crisis intervention services, and professional therapists. While it is not a replacement for professional therapy, the chatbot serves as a supplementary tool to enhance mental well-being and provide accessible support whenever needed.
